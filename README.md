# Technical Learning Roadmap

# **Fundamentals of Networking**  

## **1️⃣ Basics**  
- **Client-Server & Peer-to-Peer** – Client requests, server responds; P2P shares resources directly.  
- **LAN, MAN, WAN** – Local (small area), Metro (city-wide), Wide (global).  
- **Nodes, Hosts, Clients, Servers** – Devices in a network.  
- **Protocols & Ports** – Rules for communication (e.g., HTTP - 80, HTTPS - 443).  

## **2️⃣ Network Devices**  
- **Router** – Directs traffic between networks.  
- **Modem** – Converts digital signals.  
- **Switch, Hub, Bridge** – Connect devices within a network.  
- **NIC (Network Interface Card)** – Enables network access.  

## **3️⃣ Models & Architectures**  
- **OSI Model** – 7-layer communication framework.  
- **TCP/IP Model** – 4-layer practical approach.  
- **SOA & Microservices** – Modern distributed architectures.  

## **4️⃣ Networking Protocols**  
- **TCP/UDP** – Reliable vs. fast data transfer.  
- **IP** – Addressing & routing.  
- **HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, DNS, DHCP, ICMP** – Key communication protocols.  

## **5️⃣ IP Addressing & Subnetting**  
- **IPv4 vs. IPv6** – 32-bit vs. 128-bit addresses.  
- **Public vs. Private IPs** – Global vs. internal use.  
- **Subnetting** – Dividing networks for efficiency.  

## **6️⃣ Network Topologies**  
- **Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, Hybrid** – Different ways devices connect.  

## **7️⃣ Security & Encryption**  
- **Firewall & IPS** – Traffic filtering & intrusion prevention.  
- **SSL, TLS, HTTPS** – Secure web communication.  
- **Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption** – Single vs. key pair encryption.  

## **8️⃣ Troubleshooting & Monitoring**  
- **Ping, Traceroute, ARP** – Connectivity & packet tracking.  
- **TCPDUMP** – Capturing network packets.  

## **9️⃣ Other Concepts**  
- **NAT** – Maps private to public IPs.  
- **VPN Types** – Remote Access, Site-to-Site, SSL VPN.  
- **Reverse Proxy** – Intercepts client requests.  
- **Threat, Vulnerability, Risk** – Security fundamentals.  

🚀 **Why Learn?** Essential for IT, networking, security & troubleshooting.
